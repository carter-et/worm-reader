# worm-reader

This is just a python script to download the contents of *Worm*, by Wildbow. As far as I know, there is an overall blanket permission to download the web-series for your own use. I wrote this to help my poor friend who had committed herself to the massive task of copying and pasting the whole book and edit the styling by hand. Should permission to download ever be revoked, I will be more than happy to hide this atrocity from the net.

This script uses python3, bs4 and python-docx. 

## special thanks

Credit to redoctopus. While checking to see if anyone had already written this, I found a stats project to see the most common words per arc. I borrowed their code as a template, as they already finished the part that grabs the next link to cycle through all the pages. That is about where our similarities start and end, but I appreciate the time save regardless. You can find that project here: https://github.com/redoctopus/Worm-TFIDF/blob/master/scrape_site.py

## and finally, sorry

This is not production code, and I was not paid to make this. The quality of the code reflects that. I am sorry.
